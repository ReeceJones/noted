# Noted
A keep-it-simple-stupid note taking application.
## Why
Taking notes in word kinda sucks, and OneNote isn't my cup of tea. All I wanted was to be able to write in a simple format, and a simple application. (and no, I'm not going to run VSCode or whatever just to take notes).
## Future Plans
+ Server Sync
+ Realtime styling via some markup format.
+ Tabs

<sub>That's it. That is literally all I want from a note taking application</sub>
